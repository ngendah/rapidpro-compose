RapidPro v6 docker compose Stack
=================================

![Build Status](https://github.com/ngendah/rapidpro-compose/actions/workflows/linux.yml/badge.svg)


[RapidPro](https://github.com/rapidpro/rapidpro) is an interactive SMS builder which offers an intuitive UI for working with SMS workflows involving crafting, sending, receiving and processing SMS'es.

It's stack is composed of various services which need to be started separately and this can be challenging when trying to self host or running it locally on your machine.

This project simplifies the process by consolidating it's main services to a single configuration file easily started by a single command.


To start you will need build and run the server as follows;

#### On Linux

1. Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and confirm that docker is running.

2. Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/ngendah/rapidpro-compose.git
```

3. Change your active directory to the cloned directory.

4. Build the images and start compose.

```
docker compose up --build
```

5. Once running you can access Rapidpro from your browser.

```
https://[localhost, <ip-address>]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g `https://localhost`

>> Because the server is using a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate, the browser will issue a warning. Ignore the warning and continue. e.g on Firefox, click on `advanced` button and accept.

#### On Windows 10

1. Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and confirm that docker is running.
